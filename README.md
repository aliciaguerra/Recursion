# Recursion
- Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of the two mirrors are exactly parallel with each other, the nested images that occur are a form of inifinite recursion.
- In mathematics and computer science, it refers to a method defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition.
